# Maintance whitelist for multiple minecraft servers

There are two variants:

1. Use mcrcon for manipulate server's whitelist via native commands.
2. Use one whitelist.json file to store informations for all servers.

In second variant (optionally in first) you need to create symlinks to your main whitelist.json file for each server, remove generated `whitelist.json` generated by your server:

```bash
rm <path_to_servers_whitelist>
ln -s <full_path_to_origin_whitelist> <path_to_servers_whitelist>
```

In second variant you need to run /whitelist reload on each server to load new players in list.
